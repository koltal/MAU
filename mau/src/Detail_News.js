                    Breaking down the numbers of students admitted for the different academic programmes, the VC said the registered undergraduate fresh students are 2,341 which comprises 913 direct entry students, 154 sandwich students and 150 Distance Learning students.

                    “The undergraduate registered fresh students comprise 1,631 male and 710 female,” the VC added.

                    He announced that the University had received approval for the introduction of Medicine and Surgery in addition to reinstated degree programmes of Accounting, Business Administration, Banking and Finance, Economics, as well as Library and Information Science.

                    “I am certain we will be welcoming new students into such programmes by the next academic year,” he said.</p>
